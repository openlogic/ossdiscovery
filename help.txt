Usage: discovery [options]

The simplest usage of ossdiscovery is: ./discovery

Options are not order dependent and may be one or more of:

--always-open-archives, -a open archives even if the archive file itself
                           is identified

--conf,                 -c the absolute or relative path and filename of
                           the configuration file to use for the scan

--deliver-batch         -D the absolute or relative path to a directory
                           containing one or more scan results files to
                           deliver
                           
--deliver-results       -d existence says 'yes' deliver results to server.
                           Server destination is configured in lib/plugin
                           config.yml files.

                           --deliver-results can take an optional parameter
                             which is a path to an existing scan results
                             file to deliver

--help,                 -h print this help message

--human-results,        -u the absolute or relative path and filename for
                           the human readable results files.  The default
                           is STDOUT

--list-excluded,        -e during a scan, print a list of files that are
                           excluded and the filter that excluded each

--list-files,           -f during a scan, print a list of all files that
                           matched a rule or other criteria

--list-filters,         -g print a list of generic filters that would be
                           active during the next scan

--list-foi,             -i print a list of files of interest ossdiscovery
                           will be looking for

--list-os,              -o list the operating system, version, and distro
                           on which ossdiscovery is running

--list-plugins,         -N lists just the enabled plugins, not all plugins
                           installed

--list-projects,        -j print a list of the projects that are capable
                           of being discovered

                           Optionally append 'verbose' to get verbose output.
                           
--list-md5-dupes,       -M If the same MD5 digest is used in two or more
                           match rule definitions, then the duplicated
                           digests are printed.

--list-tag,             -t print the machine ID (tag) that will be reported
                           with scan results

--no-class-files,       -C if a jar file is not recognized, do not look inside
                           of it for known .class files

--nofollow,             -N don't follow symlinks, default is: Yes,
                           follow symlinks

--preview-results,      -R This flag will dump the machine results file to
                           the console when the scan is complete.

--production-scan,      -P This flag identifies the scan you run as a scan
                           of a production machine in the results.

--progress,             -x show progress indicator every X number of files
                           scanned - X given by the parameter to --progress

--path,                 -p the absolute or relative path of the directory to
                           scan, the default is /.  To scan multiple paths or
                           drives comma-delimit the paths or drive names (no
                           spaces after commas.)  Example:  --path x:\,c:\ 
                           
--rule-types,           -y type of rules to run - options are 'all', 'fast',
                           and 'slow', where 'slow' is more accurate than 'fast'
                           - default is 'all'

--rule-version,         -V print out rule version info and do nothing else
                           (no scan performed)

--throttle,             -T Enable throttling of the scanner so all system
                           resources are not fully dedicated to running
                           this tool.

                           No arguments accepted for this option.  See the
                           throttle_* properties in the configuration file.                                   
                           
--update-rules,         -r Gets updated scan rules from the server (discovery
                           scan not performed).

                           Providing an optional 'scan' argument (--update-rules
                           scan) will first get the updated rules from the
                           server and then go ahead and perform a discovery
                           scan of the specified --path.
                           
--version,              -v print the version of ossdiscovery

The default configuration file is conf/config.yml and can contain 
all the parameters required for a scan.  Any command line parameter given will
override what is found in the configuration file. 

If no command line parameters are given, ossdiscovery will do a root directory
scan and place the results in the directory from which the scan was invoked.
