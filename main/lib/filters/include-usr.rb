# example:
# tell the walker to scan the /usr directory

# inclusion_filters are for directories only
# the reason for this is:
# file types/extensions are included by the RuleEngine maintaining
# a list of filenames and file types/extensions it needs to match

# the hash key is an arbitrary, unique string that describes the inclusion filter
# the value is the path to the directory to scan

@inclusion_filters["Scan /usr"] = '^/usr'
