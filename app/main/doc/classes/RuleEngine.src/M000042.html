    <span class="ruby-comment cmt"># Some comments regarding the @allpackages Set</span>
    <span class="ruby-comment cmt"># This Enumerable is a Set because we need to ensure that the contents of it (all found packages) are unique.</span>
    <span class="ruby-comment cmt"># You may be thinking now, how would they ever not be unique?  Glad you asked... here's an example:</span>
    <span class="ruby-comment cmt"># - I have one handwritten dom4j rule, and one dom4j rule that was generated based off of a maven repo.</span>
    <span class="ruby-comment cmt"># - Both rules are capable of determining that dom4j version X is installed in location Y.</span>
    <span class="ruby-comment cmt"># - Well, if two different rules both tell me that, then it's non-sensical to report dom4j </span>
    <span class="ruby-comment cmt">#   version X as being installed in location Y twice.  In order to prevent this... aka, in </span>
    <span class="ruby-comment cmt">#   order for it to report that dom4j version X is installed in location Y only once, the 'eql?' and 'hash'</span>
    <span class="ruby-comment cmt">#   methods have been implemented for the Package class, and we merge subsequent project results </span>
    <span class="ruby-comment cmt">#   into a ever-growing Set (remember that a Set holds no duplicates, which is exactly what we have </span>
    <span class="ruby-comment cmt">#   as part of the multiple scan rule scenario described above).</span>
