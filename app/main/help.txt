Usage: discovery [options]

The simplest usage of ossdiscovery is: ./discovery

Options are not order dependent and may be one or more of:
--conf,           -c the absolute or relative path and filename of the configuration file to use for the scan
--deliver-batch   -D the absolute or relative path to a directory containing one or more scan results files to deliver
--deliver-results -d existence says 'yes' deliver results to server. Server destination is configured in config/config.yml
                     optionally --deliver-results can take a parameter which is a path to an existing scan results file to deliver
--help,           -h print this help message
--human-results,  -u the absolute or relative path and filename for the human readable results files.  The default is STDOUT
--geography,      -Y geography code. If the scan is submitted to census server as an anonymous scan, this overrides
                     value in the config.yml file.
--census-code,    -C the identifier code received at census registration time
--inc-path,       -I include the path/location of detected package in machine scan results
--list-excluded,  -e during a scan, print a list of files that are excluded and the filter that excluded each
--list-files,     -f during a scan, print a list of all files that matched a rule or other criteria
--list-filters,   -g print a list of generic filters that would be active during the next scan
--list-foi,       -i print a list of files of interest ossdiscovery will be looking for
--list-geos       -G print a list of geographies and their numeric codes
--list-os,        -o list the operating system, version, and distro on which ossdiscovery is running
--list-projects,  -j print a list of the projects that are capable of being discovered
                     Optionally append 'verbose' to get verbose output.
--list-md5-dupes, -M If the same MD5 digest is used in two or more match rule definitions, then the duplicated digests are printed.
--list-tag,       -t print the machine ID (tag) that will be reported with scan results
--machine-results,-m the absolute or relative path and filename for the machine readable results files.
--nofollow,       -N don't follow symlinks, default is: Yes, follow symlinks
--preview-results,-R This flag will dump the machine results file to the console when the scan is complete.
--production-scan,-P This flag identifies the scan you run as a scan of a production machine in the results.
--progress,       -x show progress indicator every X number of files scanned - X given by the parameter to --progress
--path,           -p the absolute or relative path of the directory to scan, the default is /.  To scan multiple paths or drives
                     comma-delimit the paths or drive names (no spaces after commas.)  Example:  --path x:\,c:\ 
--rule-version,   -V print out rule version info and do nothing else (no scan performed)
--throttle,       -T Enable throttling of the scanner so all system resources are not fully dedicated to running this tool.
                     No arguments accepted for this option.  See the throttle_* properties in the configuration file.                                   
--update-rules,   -r Gets updated scan rules from the server (discovery scan not performed).
                     Providing an optional 'scan' argument (--update-rules scan) will first get the updated rules
                     from the server and then go ahead and perform a discovery scan of the specified --path.
--version,        -v print the version of ossdiscovery

The default configuration file is conf/config.yml and can contain 
all the parameters required for a scan.  Any command line parameter given will
override what is found in the configuration file. 

If no command line parameters are given, ossdiscovery will do a root directory scan and place the results 
in the directory from which the scan was invoked.


Examples:
./discovery --path /home/lcox --machine-results /tmp/myscan_machine_results.txt --human-results /tmp/myscan_human_results.txt
   scans the directory /home/lcox and places the results files in the /tmp directory.


For geography codes used with --geography command line option or the geography config.yml property,
see command line option --list-geos for a full listing of geographies
