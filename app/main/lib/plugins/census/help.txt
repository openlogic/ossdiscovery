Census Plugin v1.0 --help

--list-geos,      -G print a list of geographies and their numeric code

--list-plugins,   -N lists just the enabled plugins, not all plugins installed

--geography,      -Y geography code. If the scan is submitted to census server
                     as an anonymous scan, this overrides value in the
                     config.yml file.

--census-code,    -C the identifier code received at census registration time

--census-local,   -u the absolute or relative path and filename for the human
                     readable results file.  The default is STDOUT

--census-results, -m the absolute or relative path and filename for the machine
                     readable results file to submit to OSSCensus

--production-scan,-P This flag identifies the scan you run as a scan of a
                     production machine in the results.

Example:
./discovery --path /home/lcox --census-results /tmp/myscan_machine_results.txt
            --census-local /tmp/myscan_human_results.txt

   Explanation: scans the directory /home/lcox and places the results files
                in the /tmp directory.

For geography codes used with --geography command line option or the geography
config.yml property, see command line option --list-geos for a full listing
of geographies
