##### Server properties

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# these items describe where and how scan results are sent
# 

# Note that destination_server_url and server_base_url can neither be localhost urls if proxying is being 
# used or tested.  You can't proxy a localhost URL.
destination_server_url: https://www.osscensus.org/service/scans/scanpost  # osscensus official
viewing_url: https://www.osscensus.org

# set this to true this if for some reason your network is not allowing HTTPS posts
# also change the destination_server_url to http from https, if this is the case
override_https: false

# in some cases, ie: just can't get around a proxy configuration or protocol to programmatically submit results,
# it's still possible to submit results by going to this URL in your browser and uploading the machine results file
upload_url: https://www.osscensus.org/service/upload  # manually upload scanresults-census.txt, use this URL

# username password of server submission, should be nil if no authentication is in use
username: nil
password: nil 

# IMPORTANT: proxy data needs to be nil'd out if no proxy is used. 
# Any proxy value not specified (used) is required to be nil

proxy_host: nil     # example: "192.168.10.211"
proxy_port: nil     # 4545 # 3128
proxy_user: nil     # example: corpusername
proxy_password: nil # example: corppassword

proxy_ntlm_domain: "" # typically left blank, but in case an NTLM-only proxy requires it, it's available for configuration

# geography - used when user wants to submit an anonymous scan to the census
# geography is the minimal data required for the submission
#   geography should be one of the following values:
# 
#  This value can be overridden on the command line with the --geography
#
# in order to see the numeric value to supply for this property, run ossdiscovery --list-geos
# 9999 is an invalid geography, it must be overridden to submit a scan anonymously

geography: 9999

# Census code is how the census groups multiple machines together for unified reporting purposes.
# In other words, you can see an aggregated report for all machines using the same census code.
#
# If you already have a census code from registering with the census, you can
# insert the value below or pass it on the command-line.
