# this is a example generic filter for ignoring hidden directories, those that start with a .
# such as .svn or .sshd

# if a filename or final part of a directory name matches the given filter
# it will be ignored

# a filter is defined by its unique description as the key value to a filter hash table
# the value is simply a regular expression or literal filename or basename of a directory to ignore
